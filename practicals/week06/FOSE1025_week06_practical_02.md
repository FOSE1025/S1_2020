# PRAC_02

The following are group exercises. For every group, nominate one person who will explain what you have done. The group exercises will be carried out as zoom breakouts and always the same students will be in the same group. Each time, nominate a different person so that all have the opportunite to practice their presentation skills.

## Activity 1 - Git and Github (10 minutes + 5 minutes discussion)

The lectures have mentioned git and github. These two are related but different technologies to manage software repositories and help collaboration. In groups, answer the following questions by searching the web or based on your own experience:

1. What is the difference between git and github?
2. You can use git outside of github. Give an example of how you could do this.
3. While it could be possible to use github without using git, in practice, normally you would not want to do it. Explain why.

## Activity 2 - Load multiple files (10 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

One of the tasks of the unit project (**Remember, the submission deadline for the report is 8 of May**) is to load a set of CSV files and merge them into one file. Depending on the software that you have installed in your computer, you can use Power Query or you need to find an external tool that first merges all CSV files to create a single CSV file, and then load the merged file into your computer. In your group, check if you can follow this video:

If you cannot, search the web and find a way to merge all the CSV files of this folder into one file and import it into a single Excel worksheet.

## Activity 3 - Data Exploration and Cleaning (10 minutes + 5 minutes discussion)

Use the table that you imported in activity 2 and answer the following questions:

1. What columns are categorical data and what are the categories?
2. The column with the employee name contain both the first name and the surname. Use the "text to columns" feature to split the person's name into two columns named `firstname` and `surname` respectively.
